# Machine-Learning 

## Synopsis

This project contains implementations for MachineLearning by Stanford University at coursera - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome
All the implementations are in Octave

## Implementations (Author: Rohit Jain)

1. Linear Regression with one variable

   Linear Regression with multiple variables
   
   `Application : Predict profits for a food truck`

2. Logistic Regression

   Regularised Logistic Regression
   
   `Application : Predict whether a student gets admitted into a university`

3. Multiclass Classification

   Neural Networks
   
   `Application - Handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) image recognition`

4. Neural Networks Feed Forward

   Neural Networks Backpropagation
   
   `Application - Handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) image recognition`

5. Regularised Linear Regression

   Bias-Variance
   
   Polynomial Regression
   
   `Application : Predict the amount of water fowing out of a dam`

6. Support Vector Machines

   Spam Classification
   
   `Application : Spam Filter to classify emails into spam and non-spam email`

7. K-means Clustering

   Principal Component Analysis
   
   `Application : Image compression, low-dimensional representation of face images and reconstruction`

8. Anomaly Detection

   Recommender Systems
   
   `Application : Detect anomalous behavior in server computers. Recommender system for movies`
